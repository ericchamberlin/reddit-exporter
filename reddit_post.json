They're super frugal, pessimistic, question everything...but they are incredibly progressive.

        "I was born in 1979 to two boomer parents, total latchkey kid. I wasn't parented for shit. I remember asking my parents if they saved any money up for me for college and I got laughed at. I am an only child. Like how did you screw that up.",

        "Raised by my grandparents - both born in 1916.  They were 50 the year I was born.\n\nThey were great.  I knew they cared about me, but they didn't smother me - let me figure out a lot of things on my own.\n\nFor example, when I was 16 I totaled the car they bought me.  They made sure I was OK, didn't give me a hard time, and made sure I got back behind the wheel quickly, but without being pushy about it.  They instilled a great sense of independence and self-reliance.  I'm not nearly as good of a parent as they were.\n\nI definitely have a \"whatever\" and \"live and let live\" attitude.  Basically, you do you - just don't bother me about it.  I'm still shocked that we went from that to an \"everybody has to think the same thing\" hive-mindset. WTF????",
        "Usually boomers were born after WW2, so anybody born in the first tranche of Gen X had really young boomer parents (probably struggled financially) or older silent gen parents (more traditional, conservative and well off) and had childhoods in the 70s\n\nMost Gen X i know have middle aged boomer parents (lived their adult lives through the 70s stagflation) and lived their childhoods in the 80s. Definitely large difference between the two experiences.",

The first walked into the shit storm thinking they'd have the same lives as their boomer parents, the second watched their older siblings fail and settled in for the long haul at Mum and Dad's house. He called them Global Youth (I think). I forget the third group, tried to over achieve I think.",

For instance‚Ä¶ dad was from England and his country was bombed every night , you just got used to it he would say as his school and buddy‚Äôs house was blown up. Mom was from the east coast Canada and tell tails of the Mounties busting down the door looking for moonshine her father made , freaking out the 11 kids living in two bedrooms.So ya I had to open up a can of chef boy ardee ravioli on occasion",

I have one younger sister and we lived in the middle of nowhere, so it was like being five to ten years behind bigger cities anyway. It felt like the 80‚Äôs lasted for about 15 years there. I also spent a lot of time around my silent generation grandparents, so that definitely made me a different kid than many of my peers. \nI have twins who are currently 9, so that makes me a generation ahead of their friends‚Äô parents‚Ä¶which is sometimes weird. Hell, I‚Äôm older enough to be a parent to some of their teachers in school. The gen-x definitely shows in the way these kids are raised.",

Everyone I know with silent gen parents were raised with older fashioned values with both parents in the house, dad worked mom raised the kids. My mom was out doing all the LSD, coke, and men she could find. She‚Äôs still a hippy.",

I can tell you that my husband and I are very similar in our political ideology and general philosophy on life. He tends to be a little more laid back about things, whereas I have a much more methodical approach to life. It works for us. \n\nWe appreciate the advantages we've attained in our lives. We understand that while we have worked hard there is no doubt that we have had some really lucky breaks that made all of it possible. It didn't have to be this way, we know it and are grateful that we've got what we have. Not sure where that places it in your spectrum but honestly- wtf, X is X for a reason- we don't fit into molds easily.",

        "I do t think so tbh. There are a LOT of variables. If anything, I always understood the \"latchkey\" Gen X thing to be about the kids of (middle class) Boomers whose mothers started working in the 70s, often because the father left them. Or because they wanted more money, or because now they could more easily without social sanction. The middle class kids of Silent Gen tended to have stay-at-home moms. \n\nThis is also totally about class. My Boomer's mother's mother was a very poor single mom to 3 kids in the 50s. My mom and her sibs were definitely latchkey- my grandma worked 2 jobs and was never home. They raised themselves. \n\nMy SO though, raised by older parents than me, was raised by a sahm, that was the norm for his mom's generation.\n\nAlso, \"Boomer\" is a huge generation. The ones born in 1947 are not at all like the ones born in 1960!\n\nETA a lot later for clarity sigh.",

        "I had both parents growing up, as did my wife, but I can see the difference. \n\nThree stories of my \"feral\" upbringing - as all Gen-X people, remember: no internet, no cell phones etc. etc.   \n  \nI'm in 7th Grade, my brother is in 4th grade. It's Friday. I get home from school in the afternoon. House is locked & dark.  Let myself in. There's a $20 bill taped to the refrigerator, with a note,  *\"Went away for the weekend! See you Sunday night! Love Mom & Dad\"*  THIS HAPPENED OFTEN.   \n  \nI went on a 900-mile bike trip when I was 14, took 9 days to get to my destination. Called home once mid-trip, mom said, \"Sounds like you're having fun! Call us when you get there!\" and that was about it. When I called from my destination, nobody was home so I left a message saying I would be staying at this youth hostel and would take a train home next week, so please pick me up at the station (they did). \n\nAs a high school graduation gift,  my parents gave me a one-way plane ticket to Europe, a Eurail pass, and I had  cash gifts from my grandparents, aunts and uncles - which worked out to $1,500 (equivalent of about $4,800 today). At the airport, they told me \"Let us know when you're coming back, we'll pick you up!\"   \nI had to make sure I would have enough money to buy a ticket to fly home from wherever I ended up - so about $1,000. There were no cheap airfares then. 6 Weeks later, money was running low, so I went to a TRAVEL AGENT to buy a ticket, and then I made my one and only call home (it was EXPENSIVE) to let them know where and when to get me. \n\nLots of fellow gen-x people I know have similar stories. \n\nMy Gen-X wife didn't do a solo trip of any kind until she was 19; all of her trips were family trips, with mom and dad handling all the logistics. She didn't lead a sheltered life, but she definitely didn't have the kinds of \"unbounded\" experiences I did. \n\nOf course, I understand now that I have two daughters *why* you might not want to put your 14 year old on a plane to far-far-away by herself with no particular plans for a return trip (but we did exactly that anyway with one of my daughters), and I do think that my \"feral\" upbringing, gave me both the gift and penalty of being very independent from my family and wanting to tackle big problems on my own, without asking for help. \n\nThis is well balanced by my wife's far better level of connection and communication with her immediate and extended family. I have an uncle who lives about 2 hours away from me. I have not seen him in person in over 20 years. My wife's family has large gatherings at least 2 times a year. I know more about her cousins than I do about my immediate family. So, all in all, it works out.",

We have far more in common with early millennials than early X ers as we are only a few years ahead of them.   \n\nSo.   It‚Äôs fair to assume Xers have this as well.

I don‚Äôt feel like I have the same attitude or shared experiences as most of you do. The whole concept of generations is so strange to me anyway. It should be the decade that you were born in that defines your generation. I find it very difficult to relate to someone who was already in junior high school by the time I was born. Also I absolutely HATE the word ‚Äúwhatever!!!‚Äù I know I‚Äôm probably the only one here who feels this way, but I just wanted to share my thoughts. FWIW.",

Paranoid schizophrenia that was poorly treated took her over in her 30s. \n\nI kept the reading and crafts, was feral but solitary and fiercely independent. I could fend for myself early on and took pride in walking to school, the library, to get a haircut at ages 8-11. Heck, at age 4 I was going to a clubhouse to get a soda or to a park or blackberry patch. \n\nThe timeframe made some of those things possible but I would also say that bigger influences were: poverty, being a trailer park kid in Appalachia, lack of health insurance, being an orphan (dead dad) with a single, struggling mom, being a vulnerable target to a family member sexual predator. Also being smart from a family of mixed strains of noncomformity. \n\nI rebelled against GenX itself: I wouldn't wear jeans, didn't smoke or drink or swear, was a determined geek/nerd/bookworm, gave up on makeup early, listened to James Taylor and Carol King rather than Nirvana.

Yet my older bro who also went through the tougher upbringing let his kids run wild just like we did, and if they wanted college it was on them. But my youngest bro who was kind of spoiled is raising his kids like me; spoiling them, they have their own bedrooms, tons of toys, travel sports, have saved 529s for their college, my youngest bro does this because he thinks that is the way it should be just like he got it from our older parents  \n\nNo rhyme or reason to it all.

They asked if I applied for any scholarships a month before my last day my senior year, having never broached the question before. They somehow thought the school counselors would magically tell me where to get a scholarship! My mom‚Äôs college was paid by her parents (who didn‚Äôt save, but were still working and easily paid as they went). My dad was in ROTC and went to officer‚Äôs school then the army during the last of Vietnam, so his school was paid by Uncle Sam. They thought I could pay for all of my college expenses with a part time campus job! In the early 90s you could definitely pay for room and board and some gas that way, but not tuition also. I ended up in a donut hole where my parents made too much for me to get a federal loan, but was too young to sign for the loan by myself. I had to take a few years off and work to save up and then go back signing my own loans.",

When I was in high school, my dad used it to go to law school and switch careers from public sector to private sector.\n\nIf I recall correctly, I had a bit of savings as a kid, too. My dad raided that for a motorcycle.\n\nBut no hard feelings. Just because it was earmarked for me doesn't mean it was mine. I didn't earn it, and circumstances change. I did still get a good deal on college -- \"You can have tuition & books, or dorm & meal plan. Your choice.\" I took the tuition checks, and lived at home so he still paid for it all.\n\nBut back to the original topic, my sister and I are both Gen X eight years apart.

I had grandparents from 1900's and parents from the 1930s, but some of my peers had parents and grandparents who were much much younger.

At the very least I do think it's fair to say the foundation for helicopter parenting was laid in the 80's. \n\nThe '80s brought milk cartons with photos of missing kids, \"this is your brain on drugs,\" No Child Left Behind, \"It's 10 o' clock, do you know where children are...,\" the weird republican fascination with abstinence, worries about the satanic influence of D&D and music, etc. That  growing engagement with all aspects of their children's lives was, I think, an early prototype in the evolution of the helicopter parent.",
